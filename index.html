                <h3>Our Story...</h3>
                     <p>We are a big book based group of Alcoholic Anonymous. A fellowship of men and women who would normally not mix. <br>
                    We share a common problem (an allergy of the body coupled with an obsession of the mind) and a common solution (the program and Fellowship of Alcoholics Annonymous).</p>

            <h3>Why are you all so committed to your format and focus?</h3>
            <p>As recovered alcoholics our primary purpose is to carry the message of the <a href = "https://www.aa.org/pages/en_US/alcoholics-anonymous">basic text of Alcoholics Anonymous</a> to the still suffering alcoholic. 
            In short, we are trying to not die of alcoholism, so we established a book club where the book never changes. 
            We keep reviewing the principles of the Program and trying to practice them daily in all our affairs. 
            Our group grows and our lives get better and simpler everyday.</p>
